                    Python Fundamentals gets you started with Python, a dynamic language popular for web development, big data, science, and scripting. You’ll learn the Python basics you need to start on your programming journey, including how to clean real-world data ready for analysis, use data visualization libraries, and even how to write your own Python functions.<br>

Through hands-on coding exercises you’ll then learn how to store, manipulate, and explore data using NumPy. Then it’s time to level-up as you learn how to visualize your data using Matplotlib, manipulate DataFrames and dictionaries using pandas, and write your own functions and list comprehension. By successfully completing this course, you will be able to describe the fundamentals of programming in Python.You will be able to identify basic variables and data types. You will also be able to write simple programs with Python.<br>

What’s so great about Python? The Python language is expressive and productive, it comes with a great standard library, and it’s the centre of a huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries. Python is known for its readability and simplicity. Its syntax is clear and resembles the English language, making it an excellent choice for beginners.<br> This ease of learning allows individuals to quickly grasp programming concepts and focus on problem-solving.

Python’s popularity has soared in the professional world. Many organisations and industries, including tech giants, use Python for various purposes. Learning Python enhances job prospects and increases one’s value in the job market.
