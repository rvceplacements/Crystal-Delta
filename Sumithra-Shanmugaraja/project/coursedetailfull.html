                    Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying a complete web application from start to finish. It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development, back-end web development, and database development. And full stack development is a term used to describe a software engineer or developer who works with both the front and back end of a website or application.<br> A full-stack developer is comfortable working with front-end and back-end technologies that power a website or application. 

Full-stack developers are often responsible for the entire web application development process, from start to finish, which means they must have a strong understanding of all the technologies and tools involved in web development.<br> They also need to work effectively with others on a team, as web development is typically a collaborative process. Most full-stack developers have a firm foundation in web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They also have experience with server-side technologies such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js. In addition to their technical skills, full-stack developers also deeply understand how the various parts of a website or application work together.
